# Shoots ðŸŒ¿

**Shoots** are firmware programs written for the **Sprout**â„¢ hardware module, powered by the Electrosmith Daisy Seed. Each Shoot defines how the module behaves â€” an oscillator, filter, sequencer, texture generator, or something brand new.

## ðŸŒ± Whatâ€™s in a Shoot?
Each Shoot is a self-contained firmware project with:
- A unique behavior or purpose
- Optional support for reusable code units called [**Buds**](https://github.com/clectric-diy/BUDS)
- Documentation, controls, and patch examples
