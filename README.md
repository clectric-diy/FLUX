# Shoots 🌿

**Shoots** are firmware programs written for the **Sprout**™ (or compatible) hardware module. Each Shoot defines how the module behaves as an oscillator, filter, sequencer, texture generator, or something brand new.

Each Shoot is a self-contained firmware project with:
- A unique behavior or purpose
- Optional support for reusable code units called [Buds](https://github.com/clectric-diy/BUDS)
- Documentation, controls, and patch examples
