# FLUX

**FLUX** are firmware programs written for the clectric (or compatible) hardware modules. FLUX define how the module behaves as an oscillator, filter, sequencer, texture generator, or something brand new.

Each FLUX is a self-contained firmware project with:
- A unique behavior or purpose
- Documentation, controls, and patch examples
